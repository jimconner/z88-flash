# z88-flash

An open-source 1MB Flash Expansion (AM29F080) PCB  for the Cambridge Z88.

This work is based upon the Z88 connector design shared by XavSnap at [SinclairZXWorld Z88 Forum](https://sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=4431) - Thank you XavSnap!

I found that I had 4 x AM29F080 (1MBit * 8) Flash memory chips on a stick which came out of a Cisco router in the 1990s. This chip is reported to be compatbile with the Cambridge Z88, so as a fun project I decided that I'd use one of the cheap PCB manufacturing services and make myself some Flash expansion cards.

If you're looking for a one-off I'd recommend purchasing Rakewell's reasonably priced bare PCB, but I was more looking for a fun project. I also wanted a solder paste stencil for hot air reflow soldering which Rakewell do not provide.

I found the component stencil and footprint for the AM29F080 at Ultra Librarian - I have not included them in this archive as they are probably not licenses for redistribution.

If you're just looking to order PCBs without making any modifications then the `Z88_1MB_Flash.zip` file contains all of the gerbers and drill files you need to upload. You should just need to upload the file and hit 'order-pcb' at your preferred manufacturer.

This project is released as an Open Source Hardware offering.
